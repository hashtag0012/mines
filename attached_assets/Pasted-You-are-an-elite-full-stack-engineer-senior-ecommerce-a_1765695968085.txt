You are an elite full-stack engineer, senior ecommerce architect, and high-end fashion product designer.

Build a production-ready premium ecommerce website for a fashion brand called MINES CLOTHING.

The brand is Instagram-first, minimalist streetwear, with a calm, confident, editorial feel. The website must look intentional, exclusive, and modern — never template-like or gimmicky.

BRAND CONTEXT

Brand: Mines Clothing
Audience: 16–28, urban, fashion-aware, mobile-first
Brand Traits: Minimal, bold, controlled, modern
Current Status: Store is closed, preparing for future drops

DESIGN & UX DIRECTION (STRICT)

Mobile-first (desktop adapts from mobile)

Minimal color palette (black, off-white, muted neutrals)

Editorial typography

Large imagery, strong spacing, confident layout

No gradients, no neon, no over-decoration

Animation Rules:

Use GSAP + ScrollTrigger

Animations must be subtle and purposeful

Examples:

Hero text reveal on load

Product cards gently fade/slide into view

Section transitions with smooth easing

No scroll hijacking, no excessive parallax

Performance always comes before animation.
